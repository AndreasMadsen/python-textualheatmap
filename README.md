# textualheatmap

**Create interactive textual heatmaps for Jupiter notebooks.**

I originally published this visualization method in my distill paper
https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/. In this context, it is used
as a saliency map for showing which parts of a sentence are used to predict
the next word. However, the visualization method is more general-purpose than
that and can be used for any kind of textual heatmap purposes.

`textualheatmap` works with python 3.6 or newer and is distributed under the
MIT license.

heatmap = TextualHeatmap(

    facet_titles = ['GRU', 'LSTM']
)
# Set data and render plot, this can be called again to replace
# the data.
heatmap.set_data(data)
# Focus on the token with the given index. Especially useful when
# `interactive=False` is used in `TextualHeatmap`.
heatmap.highlight(159)
